# SC-RNAseq and Bulk RNAseq of COPD airway organoid

This project contains the R scripts of single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analysis of airway organoids derived from healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The manuscript <The establishment of COPD organoids to study host-pathogen interaction reveals enhanced viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in bronchi> has been accepted in-principle by Nature Communications.

## Data
SC-RNAseq data: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186017
Bulk RNAseq data: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE201465

## R scripts
AirwayOrganoid_script.R describes the pipeline used for the single-cell transcriptome analysis.

Comparison-to-bulkRNAseq_script.R describes the pipeline used to compare the functional enrichment findings of the sc-RNAseq to bulk RNAseq datasets from public depository, including GSE124180, GSE162154 and GSE146532, as well as in-house datasets.

Organoid_Pseudomonas.R describes the analysis of bulk transcriptomes of non-diseased and COPD NPOs were either mock-treated or infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) for 6 hours.
