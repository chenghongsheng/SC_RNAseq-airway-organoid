# SC-RNAseq of COPD airway organoid

This project contains the R scripts of single-cell transcriptomic analysis of airway organoids derived from healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The manuscript <The establishment of COPD organoids to study host-pathogen interaction reveals enhanced viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in bronchi> is currently under review.

## Data
Sequencing data is available here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186017

## R scripts
AirwayOrganoid_script.R describes the pipeline used for the single-cell transcriptome analysis.

Comparison-to-bulkRNAseq_script.R describes the pipeline used to compare the functional enrichment findings of the sc-RNAseq to bulk RNAseq datasets from public depository, including GSE124180, GSE162154 and GSE146532, as well as in-house datasets.
